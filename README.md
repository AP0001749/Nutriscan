## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager
 - Google Gemini Flash (recommended)
- Nutritionix API account for nutrition data

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd nutriscan
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file and add your API keys:
   ```bash
   # AI & Vision APIs
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   CLARIFAI_API_KEY=your_clarifai_api_key
   USDA_API_KEY=your_usda_api_key
   
   # NextAuth Configuration
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_string
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   
   # OAuth Providers (Optional)
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
   
   # Database
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
   ```
   
   **Note**: For development, the credentials provider allows any email/password. For production, configure OAuth providers or implement proper user authentication.

4. **Initialize the database**
   The first time you run the app, navigate to `/api/init-db` in your browser to create the necessary database tables.

5. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Usage

### Scanning Food
1. Navigate to the "Scan" page
2. Take a photo or upload an image of your food
3. Wait for AI analysis (usually 2-5 seconds)
4. View detailed nutrition information and health insights
5. Log the meal to your Food Diary from the results page

### Dashboard
1. Visit the "Dashboard" to see your logged meals for the day.
2. Clear the daily log if needed.

## Deployment

This application uses a local SQLite database (`dev.db`), which is not suitable for serverless deployment platforms like Vercel or Netlify.

### For Local Deployment or a Single Server
1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Start the production server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### For Serverless Platforms (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
Before deploying to a serverless platform, you **must** migrate the database from SQLite to a serverless-compatible database like **Vercel Postgres**, **Neon**, or **Supabase**.

1. **Create a new PostgreSQL database** on your chosen platform.
2. **Update the database connection logic** in `src/lib/db.ts` to use a PostgreSQL client (e.g., `pg` or `@vercel/postgres`).
3. **Add your database connection string** to your environment variables.
4. **Import your GitHub repository** to Vercel (or your chosen platform).
5. **Add environment variables** in the platform's dashboard.
6. **Deploy**.
   ```
2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Recent Updates

- Fixed hydration errors related to environment variables by implementing client-side detection
- Added new About page with detailed information about the application
- Improved responsive design for better mobile experience
- Enhanced error handling for API calls

## Authentication

NutriScan uses **NextAuth.js** for authentication with support for multiple providers:

### Supported Authentication Methods
1. **Google OAuth** - Sign in with Google account
3. **Credentials** - Email/password authentication (development mode accepts any credentials)

### Setting Up OAuth Providers

#### Google OAuth
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable Google+ API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
5. Add authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
6. Copy Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env.local`

### Generating NEXTAUTH_SECRET
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## API Keys Configuration

For full functionality, this application requires the following API keys:

1. **Google Gemini** - For AI-powered food analysis and health insights
2. **Clarifai API** - For advanced food recognition with 98% accuracy
3. **USDA FoodData Central API** - For comprehensive nutrition information

We've made it easy to set up your API keys:

1. First, configure your API keys in `.env.local` file
2. Verify your configuration by visiting `/api/env-check`

3. Start the application with API keys check:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:with-api-check
   ```

The application includes a demo mode that activates automatically if API keys are not found, but for the best experience, we recommend configuring all APIs.

### Using Anthropic (Claude Haiku 3) Free Tier

NutriScan is configured to use Anthropic's Claude models by default. To use the free tier / Haiku 3 model set the following environment variable in your `.env.local` file:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
# optional, defaults to claude-haiku-3
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-haiku-3
```

Notes:
- The app uses a minimal fetch-based client so no extra SDK is required. The `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` variable lets you change the model if you have access to other Anthropic models.
- Confirm your Anthropic account limits — "free tier" setups can still have rate or usage constraints depending on the account.
### Using Google Gemini Flash

NutriScan is configured to use Google Gemini Flash by default. To use Gemini Flash set the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-flash
GEMINI_API_URL=optional_custom_endpoint

- The app uses a minimal fetch-based client so no extra SDK is required. `GEMINI_MODEL` lets you change the model if you have access to other Gemini variants.
